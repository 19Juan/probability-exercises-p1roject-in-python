Inside this repository, you will find a file called `./notebook/problems.ipynb` with the exercises you need to finish to complete it.

## ðŸŒ± How to start this project

This project and its repository comes with the necessary files to start working.

1. Make a fork of [this repository](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/probability-exercises-project-in-python) into your github account.
2. Open the recently created fork repository using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.
3. Once it has finished opening you can go ahead and open the `problems.ipynb` file and start solving each exercise inside the notebook.

## ðŸš› How to deliver this project

Once you are finished solving the exercises make sure to commit your changes, push to your repository fork and go to 4Geeks.com to upload the repository link.

## Solutions

We also incorporated a `./notebook/solutions.ipynb` file that we strongly suggest you only use if you are stuck for more than 30min or if you have already finished and want to compare it with your approach.
